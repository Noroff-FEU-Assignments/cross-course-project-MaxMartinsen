    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
        In answering this question, I would break all my actions into several examples, since the proposal to secure the site is invested and time wasted.<br> 
        When it comes time to discuss the security system, basically the webmaster, developer and site owner is aware of the hacker attacks.<br> 
        Attacks harm the reputation of the resource and its ranking in the search results, which ultimately leads to a decrease in traffic and affects the income of the owners if the project is commercial.<br> 
        This is why my website security proposal collects basic security data.<br> 
        Keeping only necessary customer data, hackers can't decorate what you don't have.<br> 
        Carry out all necessary actions to eliminate SQL injections.<br> 
        Prevent cross-site CSRF forgery, mostly in web frameworks.<br>
        There is also little protection for sites and clients. For my part, the security applications of the project must always follow, and the customer must be sure that the developer has taken all the necessary actions to implement security.<br> 
        To do this, you need to periodically test the site, quickly fix problems if they are identified, and monitor to ensure that all vulnerabilities are under control.<br> 
        Summing up, this is one part of the discussion in the earnings of the site, which should be properly worked out with the client when creating the site.</p>
